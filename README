libxnm is a library for parsing the XNM format. For more info about
the xnm format see below. libxnm is a c-library for parsing, in
memory storage, and output of the xnm format.

THE XNM FORMAT 

XNM stands for (Xnm is Not a Markup language) in the spirit of
recursive definitions common in the GNU world. xnm is a simple
recursively defined serialization syntax that is well suited to be
used as a storage format for any program storing or communicating
complex datastructures. In contrast to the XML standard, XNM was built
to be as concise as possible. It is built upon three types string,
tables, and arrays. Here is a short string in Xnm format:

   home_dir : "/home/dir"
   path : ["/usr/bin" "/usr/local/bin" "/etc"]

Here is another more complex example:

   objects : [
     {
       type : contour
       points : [ {x:0 y:1} {x:3.5 y:2.1} {x:5 y:8} ]
       fill : T
       color : { R:200 G:0 B:0 }
       name : "A red contour"
     }
     {
       type : polygon
       center : {x=10 y=50}
       sides : 5
       rotation : 32
     }
   ]

Other similar projects are YAML and JSON.

xnm also supports embedded binary strings as follows:

bin => <size=7>ABC
DEF

This defines binary string of size 7 with the contents "ABC\nDEF". Binary
strings may be retrieved through the following code:

    const gchar *val_const_gchar;
    xnm_value_get_binary(val,
                         key,
                         &val_const_gchar,
                         &len);
